## What is tokenization?
Tokenization is the process of creating a digital token that represents complete or fractional ownership of an asset. Similar to how businesses can divide ownership into shares of stock, tokenization provides a verified way for any entity to partition ownership of a controlled asset.
Tokenizing arbitrary assets democratizes financial markets, making it easier for investors to access a wider variety of assets.
## Why tokenize assets?
The fundamental goal with Blockit's style of tokenization is to unlock liquidity and new opportunities for investors and asset holders.

Democratized, transparent ownership of productive assets is key to socioeconomic stability. Tokenizing such assets enables fractional ownership, portability, and global liquidity - which serve humanity in two ways:

One, these factors enable people to collectively own and benefit from all productive assets. When the environment is right, this model can be used to develop DAO-governed projects like co-housing projects and worker-owned businesses as well as funding clean energy infrastructure, micro-ventures, or rainforest conservation.

When done in a way that is compliant, transparent, and trustworthy, tokenization offers new levels of control and access to innovative investment opportunities.

Tokenization can provide people with the opportunity to engage in collective patterns of ownership that capture global markets and economies in a way that has never before been possible.

As urbanization exponentially increases while arable land and wildlife habitat dwindle, there is an urgent need to more broadly share the burdens and upside of ownership. History provides us with examples; co-ops and collectives of the past serve as wellsprings for conceptualizations of ownership that utilize trust in a way that all members of the collective benefit. 

Blockit provides a framework for such projects.

Transparent, verifiable, private ownership is an essential building block for a free and democratic society: how else are we, as individuals, going to collectively serve ourselves?

Proudhon, known for being imprisoned from 1849 to 1852 for criticizing President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, outlined this same problem in his 1840 *Qu'est-ce que la propriété?*

> The people wanted the conditions of ownership to be alike for all;
> they thought that every one should enjoy and freely dispose of his
> possessions his income and the fruit of his labor and industry. 
> 
> The people did not invent property; but as they had not the same
> privileges in regard to it, which the nobles and clergy possessed,
> they decreed that the right should be exercised by all under the same
> conditions.
>
> The more obnoxious forms of property - statute-labor,
> mortmain, maîtrise, and exclusion from public office - have
> disappeared; the conditions of its enjoyment have been modified: the
> principle still remains the same. **There has been progress in the
> regulation of the right; there has been no revolution.**

182 years later, Blockit is this revolution.
## Benefits of arbitrary tokenization
Tokenization offers several advantages over slow-moving, traditional methods of asset ownership and management. For example, blockchain tokenization allows for
### Easier transfer of ownership
Tokenization makes it easier to transfer ownership of an asset. With traditional methods of asset ownership, such as a certificate of title or a bill of sale, the transfer of proof-of-ownership can be complex and time-consuming. By contrast, decentralized platforms allow for the instant and frictionless transfer of tokens.
### Greater liquidity
Illiquid assets, such as real estate or artwork, can be difficult to trade. This is because there are often not enough buyers or sellers in the market at any given time for a market to be made. As a result, buyers and sellers can be forced to accept unfavorable prices.

DeFi liquidity pools and AMMs provide a blueprint to solve this problem en masse: by harnessing large liquidity pools, liquidity can be given to any asset of any class so long as it's wrapped in a token.
### Transparent, community-driven management
On blockit, asset managers can choose to have their portfolio managed by a custom DAO, all managed on the Fantom chain.
Companies like BlackRock cannot have an operational chokehold on this kind of asset management. Anyone in the world should be able to create, govern, and own their own custom sets of asset classes.
### Lower barriers to market opportunities
### Fractional ownership
## How to wrap off-chain assets in crypto tokens
In short, asset tokenization works by taking a real-world asset and wrapping it in a digital token. This token can then be listed on Blockit, where people can buy and swap it at any time for another token or cryptocurrency.

Suppose somebody wishes to crowdfund the purchase of a broken private Jet that influencers can rent by the hour to take pictures in:

1. Someone responsible becomes the asset manager, who lists the investment opportunity on the Blockit chain via a no-code smart contract builder that mints tokens and, if necessary for compliance, establishes identity-based red tape
2. Since whiteglove custodial services are not part of this venture, the asset manager sets up a portfolio DAO where token holders will vote on custodial decisions
3. Investors each contribute to the purchase of the Jet by exchanging denomination tokens of the lister's choosing (probably fiat stablecoins) for fully-custom "JET" tokens minted during portfolio/asset listing
4. "JET" tokens are now backed by the investor's deposit
5. Once the manager has the actual Jet asset, they rent it out to influencers and collect fiat income
6. Asset manager converts fiat into the denomination asset
7. Manager deposits these denomination assets to the blockit portfolio, automatically converting them into backed JET tokens
8. JET is then proportionally distributed to token holders via smart contracts
9. Since JET is backed by a pool of the denomination asset, the token is liquid and tradable
10. If an investor chooses to exit their position, smart contracts will automatically swap JET for the denomination asset, effectively selling JET back to the portfolio
11. The portfolio contracts will then automatically convert the denomination asset into whatever asset the investor wishes to swap JET for, and the swap can be made

The main risk here is that there is no code preventing the asset manager from going rogue and ghosting the DAO, keeping the physical asset + income for themselves. This would cause JET tokens to only be backed by the deposited denomination asset, which may have been withdrawn by the asset manager to purchase the jet.

In this case where the initial investment capital is spent before any income or value is produced, the DAO might want to hold collateral from the asset manager or establish a contract clause that forces the value of the initial investment to be re-deposited in the portfolio vault as soon as the asset generates enough income to refill the denomination vault.

Until the portfolio vault contains as much stable assets as the investors initially put in, the investment is illiquid and only backed by the trust in the asset manager to responsibly maintain the jet and pay dividends. It is up to the investor to decide whether this perspective is acceptable.

To create a new portfolio, fund managers set parameters in the portfolio profile:
13. Portfolio name
14. Ticker symbol
15. Denomination asset
16. Management fees
17. Deposit/transferability restrictions (whitelists)
18. Transferability of tokens

## blockit.finance
is a new DeFi platform that allows investors to buy and sell custom assets, in custom portfolios, in a compliant and transparent manner.

The platform starts with identity. Professional asset managers and investors can list their public, verifiable credentials for all to browse. If an investor is comfortable investing in an asset manager whose only credentials are a 64-character 0x address, that is their sole decion. Investors must make the judgment call on who they trust, and we will provide a platform for managers and investors to verify a) who they are and b) why they're trustworthy.

Once an asset manager decides to create a portfolio, the first step is to mint smart contracts representing the asset's ownership structure. These contracts can then be used to generate asset-backed ERC-721 or ERC-20 or ERC-1155 tokens on the Fantom mainnet. These asset-backed tokens are then instantly swappable, providing investors with a liquid and secure way to invest in a variety of assets.

The blockit chain infrastructure will provide an efficient and cost-effective way to manage and trade a variety of assets. It will also provide transparency and security to investors, as all transactions on the Fantom mainnet are explorable.

The blockit.finance platform is designed to be beginner-friendly and easy to use. Asset managers build portfolios with custom asset classes, set up any necessary legal red tape, and list items; while investors can browse and trade assets in these portfolios with just a few clicks.
### Liquidity
Larger liquidity pools are more stable and useful.

Blockit will create a liquidity pool shared by all , allowing for the immediate and automatic exchange of tokens.
Liquidity providers can provide liquidity for an asset without being financially associated with the asset, since they are only providing liquidity and not taking on any ownership risk.

After selecting a denomination token (which will be deposited into the portfolio in exchange for the asset and used to measure 'share' price and portfolio performance,
## Trust, transparency, and compliance
The blockit.finance platform is built on transparency. Trust and security follow.

### Reputation, on and off-chain
Investments are always based on trust. There is no trust-free transaction or investment.

So Blockit will enable professional asset managers and investors to attach government-issued credentials to their profiles and portfolios, giving users the confidence to trade and list in a secure and compliant environment with trustworthy participants.

Blockit is the platform for reputable institutional investors looking to achieve DeFi liquidity.

Traditionally, regulators have relied on third-party audits to ensure that unqualified retail investors stay away from predatory schemes. However, running these audits can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, constituting a significant barrier to entry for unestablished innovators. With the Blockit platform, regulators will have access to a secure, transparent, and open audit trail of all activity on the exchange. Search protocols will only improve as blockchain adoption increases.

Smart contracts are fantastic mechanisms to help asset and portfolio managers set up red tape, view past activity, and make sure that any legal terms of investment are followed.

The Blockit platform has a baked-in rating and review system that will allow both users and regulators to independently assess the historical integrity of any investment, manager, or investor.

Decentralization and openness not only give institutionally established investors and portfolio managers a secure and open method of bringing their portfolio into the DeFi ecosystem, but it also gives alternative asset managers and investors a platform to get their foot in the door and offer innovative investment products to anyone in the world.

We see this openness and visibility as a key differentiator in our platform and one that will foster transparency and trust between investors and asset managers.
## Compliance
Fundamentally, the sets of philosophies powering DeFi are hugely synergistic with the ️values of constitutional democracies. In free societies, the goals of regulators are to protect the integrity of markets and the wealth of investors.

DeFi is like the wild west of finance: there are no laws, scams and tiger bank equivalents are rampant, and law enforcement mostly occurs post, not pre-infraction.

Blockit allows asset managers to verify an investor's certifications before participating in an investment, paving the way for portfolio-specific red tape.

The DeFi ecosystem needs more operational synergy with 'traditional,' compliant, and institutional investment activity . Asset managers need instant, simple, and easy access to high-quality services ensuring their markets and investors are safeguarded in their innovative investment products.

The SEC released a spotlight on ICOs detailing that many tokens are, in fact, securities. If an asset manager deems it necessary to file their token as a security with a regulatory body, Blockit certification uploads will make the KYC and AML process as frictionless as possible.

Blockit.finance will liaise with local service providers to maintain automatic and straightforward in-country filing and KYC/AML features for tokens that wish to be registered as securities.
### "Don't trust, verify"
is the philosophical nucleus of the crypto metaverse. Unsurprisingly, this idea is fundamentally critical for Blockit. This is something democratic governments and institutions can and should get behind.

Our belief that regulatory cohesion is critical for the long-term success of DeFi does not influence our deeply-held notion that anything which can be shut down by a single person or government order is not DeFi. Blockit is a token protocol, not a company.

We believe that regulatory cohesion is essential to the long-term success of DeFi, and will play an important role in building bridges between the traditional financial system and innovative blockchain-based financial systems.
## The future of asset tokenization

In the future, anything can and will be traded on global markets as assets. The BlackRock model will swallow the world through crypto, and everyone should be able to participate.

Asset tokenization is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize the way we invest. By making it easier for investors to access a wider variety of assets, tokenization can help to grow portfolios and eliminate market inefficiencies.
The blockit.finance platform is designed to bring this power to investors and asset managers everywhere. We believe that asset tokenization is the future of investing, and we're excited to be leading the way.
